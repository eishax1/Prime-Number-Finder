# Prime Number Finder

This is a Python program that lets users input numbers, detects prime numbers, and calculates the difference between the largest and smallest prime numbers entered. The program provides two options for user interaction: 
- A **for loop** based input method
- A **while loop** based input method

## Features

- Error handling for non-numeric inputs.
- Handles negative numbers and ensures only positive numbers are considered for prime number checking.
- Displays a list of unique prime numbers entered by the user.
- Calculates and displays the difference between the largest and smallest prime numbers.
- Menu-based interface for ease of use.

## Program Overview

- **Main Menu**: 
  - `1. FOR LOOP`: Enter numbers in a for loop fashion.
  - `2. WHILE LOOP`: Enter numbers until the user wishes to stop.
  - `3. EXIT`: Exit the program.
  
- **Prime Numbers**: The program checks if a number is prime. If it's prime and unique, it will be added to an array.
  
- **Calculations**: After entering numbers, the program will display the list of unique prime numbers and calculate the difference between the largest and smallest prime numbers entered.

## Error Handling

- The program prompts the user for numeric inputs and checks for negative numbers.
- It ensures valid entries before proceeding with prime number checks.
